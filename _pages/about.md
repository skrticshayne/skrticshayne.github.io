Hello! I'm **Shayne Skrtic**, an undergraduate at Xavier University majoring in **Biology** with minors in **Computer Science** and **Chemistry**. I am passionate about research, computational biology, and applying technology to solve complex biological problems.

My work spans **bioinformatics, computational biochemistry, molecular dynamics, statistical modeling and laboratory experimentation**. I have two published papers:  

- *COSMIC Database and Structural Modeling Analysis of CYP2D6 Mutations in Human Cancers* (2024)  
- *Measuring Cell Dimensions in Fission Yeast Using Machine Learning* (2024)  

I am currently a **Quality Assurance Microbiologist at Q Laboratories**, where I perform and validate microbiological techniques while ensuring compliance with USDA and FDA guidelines.  

I am also involved in **aging-related cancer research**, applying computational and experimental methods to study disease mechanisms.  

I have experience **developing data analysis pipelines** to support lab research, helping streamline and automate complex workflows.  

Previously, I contributed to **bioinformatics software development** at OakVar Bioinformatics, enhancing genomic analysis tools and collaborating with a multidisciplinary team of biologists and software engineers.

This website showcases my academic work, projects, publications, posters, and professional experience. You can explore my **portfolio**, learn about my **publications**, and see my **research contributions** in computational biology, bioinformatics, and experimental biology.

I am enthusiastic about **collaboration, problem-solving, and interdisciplinary research**, and I aim to pursue a **PhD** to further advance computational and systems biology at the intersection of biology and technology.

Feel free to explore the site to learn more about my work, or get in touch through the contact links provided.
